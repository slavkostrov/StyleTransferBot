# StyleTransferBot

This package introduces implementation of Machine Learning Telegram bot, that contains transfer style techniques.
These techniques (include slow style transfer and pretrained fast transfer models) can be used for transferring any styles
onto user's images.

### Usage example (see [run.py](run.py)):

```python
import os
from TransferBot.bot import TransferBot


if __name__ == "__main__":
    token = os.getenv("TG_STYLE_BOT_TOKEN")
    bot = TransferBot(
        bot_token=token,
        timeout_seconds=600,
        max_tasks=2
    )
    bot.run()
```

### Deploy with Docker:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Write an `.env` file with your `TG_STYLE_BOT_TOKEN` in it.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` and wait for the build to finish, run.py will be used in container, 
so you can edit if you want to.

That's it. Enjoy your dockerized transfer style bot everywhere. ðŸš€

### Advanced options:
* **Custom models**

You can write your own model, that will implement `TransferBot.model.ModelABC` interface. 
After, you can register this model. See example bellow:

```python
from TransferBot.model import register_model, MunkModel

if __name__ == "__main__":
    register_model(MunkModel, model_id="custom_model")
    # run bot
```

* **Custom bot's messages**

You can simply change bot's answers style by edit module with all templates. 
You can find it in [bot_answers.py](./TransferBot/bot/bot_answers.py).

After that you'll see your model in bot keyboard.

### Tests:

Package contains several tests, which you can find in `/tests` directory.
To run them, you just need to write a few commands:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt # setup env
pip install -e .                # install bot package
pip install pytest              # install pytest
pytest testing/                 # run tests
```

### Runtime examples:
